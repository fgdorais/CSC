\section{Fr\'echet Spaces}

A topological space is \emph{Fr{\'e}chet} (or \T1) if every singleton is closed.
Equivalently, if \(x\) and \(y\) are two distinct points in a Fr{\'e}chet space then there is a basic open \(U_i\) that contains \(y\) but not \(x.\)
In a weak csc space, \(x \notin U_i\) is a \(\Pi^0_1\) statement, there may be no effective way such an index \(i\) from the pair of points \(x,y.\)

\begin{definition}[\RCA]
  A csc space \(\csc{X}\) with basis \(\mathcal{U}=\seq{U_i}_{i \in I}\) is \emph{effectively Fr{\'e}chet} if there is a function \(h:X \times X \to I\) such that if \(x \neq y\) then \(x \notin U_{h(x,y)}\) and \(y \in U_{h(x,y)}.\)
\end{definition}

In  a strong csc space, both \(x \notin U_i\) and \(y \in U_i\) are decidable, so we can simply search for a suitable index \(i.\)

\begin{proposition}[\RCA]
  Every strong csc space which is Fr{\'e}chet is effectively Fr{\'e}chet.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[\RCA]
  The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}[\upshape(1)]
  \item Arithmetic Comprehension \textup(\ACA\textup).
  \item Every weak csc space which is Fr{\'e}chet is effectively Fr{\'e}chet.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The implication (1)\THEN(2) is immediate, so we show how to construct a Fr{\'e}chet space which is not effectively Fr{\'e}chet from a failure of \ACA.

  \TODO
\end{proof}
